# ます CONJUGATION SIMPLIFIED

All verbs end in a "u" sound. Present tense conjugation is [masu verb stem] + masu[sen]

## Godan Verb Stem 
"u" sound turns into "i"

u > i
ku > ki
su > shi
etc

hanasu (to speak) > hana**shi**masu

and to make it negative, you instead use "masen" instead of "masu"

nomu -> nomi -> nomi**masen**

## Ichidan Verb Stem
Ichidan verbs end with "iru" or "eru"
ex. taberu (to eat) ta-b**e-ru**

This means you have to check the previous sound if you're trying to conjugate a verb that ends in "ru"

To conjugate, cut the "ru" and add "masu"
To conjugate negative, it's the same as [Godan Verb Stem](#Godan-Verb-Stem)

### Ichidan Exceptions
There are ten that I'm too lazy to write down so...

## Irregular Verbs
kuru (to come) -> kimasu
suru (to do) -> shimasu

## Use Case of Present Tense
You can use just a verb as a sentence which is nice
ex. utaimasu -> I will sing / I do sing
