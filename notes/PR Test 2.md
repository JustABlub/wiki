## Reading Review
#### Question 6
Q: The girl uses the word "ransacking" (line 56) mainly to emphasize that her search was
    A) comprehensive
    B) disruptive
    C) shocking
    D) silly
Original Answer: D
Correct Answer:  A
Reasoning:
The girl uses the word ransacking to emphasize that she look everywhere for that "rare fur coat". My original answer silly doesn't make sense here because she doesn't carry any sense of silliness in the sentence. In fact, it's quite the opposite as in the sentence, the narrator states that she spoke with "a determined air..."

#### Question 14
Q: Based on the passage, de Wall and Johanowicz's experiment most likely ruled out which potential claim about social learning?
    A) The habits an animal learns from another species will last only as long as they remain in close contact with that other species
    B) Individuals that are better at learning behaviors socially are more likely to pass on their beneficial traits to the next generation of their species
    C) Individuals that are raised by a different species are more likely to be ostracized by members of their own species.
    D) Animals that learn behaviors from their own or a different species can pass those behaviors on to their offspring in the next generation of their own species.
Original Answer: C
Correct Answer: A
Reasoning: 
Option C can't be correct because animals being ostracized by their own species doesn't have to do with social learning. It can't be B or D because these claims are supported by the experiment, leaving me with A. For extra reasoning on why it's A, the passage in lines 40-45 states that "the fostered rhesus macaques learned the behavior of reconciliation, and it stuck with them even after they were placed back with other rhesus macaques."

#### Question 20
Q: Information about which of the following is presented in the graph but NOT discussed in the passage?
    A) Social learning within a species
    B) Social learning from another species
    C) Cross-fostering birds
    D) Animal feeding behaviors
Original Answer: B
Correct Answer: C
Reasoning: 
First, it can't be B or A because the main topic of the passage is about social learning within and from another species. While the graph (a bar graph comparing the relative size of prey obtained by adult birds either raised by the same species or fostered by different species) does show the feeding patterns of animal feeding, it's also mentioned in paragraph 4 about lemurs and their eating behaviors. C has to be the correct answer, not only because everything else has been ruled out but also because cross-fostering birds was never talked about in the passage. This is what confused me because I didn't know that macaques aren't birds but actually primates.

#### Question 26
Q: In stating that the two papers publication "animates the debate" (line 58), Andreae suggests that the papers
    A) generated an unresolvable controversy
    B) energized a diminishing effort
    C) created interest in a dry subject 
    D) presented seemingly contradictory evidence
Original Answer: C
Correct Answer: B
Reasoning: D
B and C cannot be correct because the studies on whether or not the human body can form new neurons as an adult is states multiple times that it's something of hot debate (line 1) and multiple researches were conducted to try and understand the topic more. Answer choice A doesn't make sense because the topic isn't unresolvable. D is correct because the two papers' findings directly contradict each other, thus animating or fanning the flames of a debate.

#### Question 27
Q: Based on Passage 2, Sorrells would most likely agree with which of the following statements about neurogenesis in the human dentate gyrus?
    A) Its correlation with neurological disease has been overlooked
    B) It is not an elegant explanation for learning capacity 
    C) Its frequency does not differ significantly between younger and older adults
    D) Its evolutionary purpose is not well understood
Original Answer: No Answer
Correct Answer: C
Reasoning:
First of all, I completely forgot to circle an answer choice, not that it would've helped since I had the correct answer crossed out. Answer choices B and D don't make any sense since in Passage 2, Sorrells only talks about dentate gyrus (DG) in the research. Meaning since learning capacity and evolution isn't in the passage, Sorrells can't make a claim on it. Left with A and C, it's pretty obvious which answer it has to be since lines 65-68 states that there was no change in neurogenesis after people turned 13, fulfilling the "does not differ significantly between younger and older adults".

#### Question 32
Q: The author's descriptions of John Bull most directly support which larger claim?
    A) Withdrawing from the public stage would only weaken an already threatened state
    B) It is more difficult to abdicate a position of power than to safeguard it
    C) Financial stability is incompatible wit ruling compassionately and maintaining shared traditions
    D) Having an overextended sphere of influence can jeopardize personal welfare
Original Answer: C
Correct Answer: D
Reasoning: 
This is one of the reasons I should always read the little blurb at the top of the passage. The little blurb states that John Bull is "a satirical figure used to personify England". This makes things a bit more clear on what the scope of the author's larger claim is. Obviously A is incorrect here as John Bull never withdrew from public as he continues to be everyone's champion, albeit a little more passive after losing all his money. B can't be it either since he never was in a position of power that he could step down from. C tripped me up because a good portion of the passage talks about how John Bull had difficulties with his finances but it being incompatible with ruling compassionately doesn't really make sense here because John Bull never ruled over anyone. However D makes sense, not only because it's the last answer choice remaining but because like in the passage with John Doe, England trying to "help" and be everywhere at once strained their economy, like it did for John Bull.

#### Question 33
Q: During the course of the passage, the central focus shifts from
    A) describing a symbolic figure to sounding a call for caution and consideration regarding future conduct
    B) celebrating the merits of a relatable hero to denouncing that hero as a national embarrassment
    C) making light of a character's flaws to casting doubt on his ability to improve a situation
    D) condemning a character for his unwise familial attitudes to mourning his fall from prominence
Original Answer: C
Correct Answer: A
Reasoning:
The key words that makes C a wrong answer is "making light". Nowhere in the passage does the narrator make fun of/tease/joke/etc about  John Bull. Understanding this naturally leads to the correct answer A. There was never any celebration, ruling out B and D is too narrow in its scope. This leaves us with only A.

#### Question 34
Q: According to the passage, there is a distinct contrast between
    A) having well-meaning intentions and acting in one's best interest
    B) the responsibility to protect family and the duty to volunteer for one's country
    C) growing up as part of the aristocracy and earning a position of influence
    D) respecting ancestral traditions and choosing to neglect one's modern obligations
Original Answer: D
Correct Answer: A
Reasoning: 
While at first, D seems like a likely answer since John Bull refuses to abandon his "ancestral traditions" and adapt to modern ways of thinking and living, this is not a contrast but a cause and effect, thus ruling D out. C and B both are contrasts but aren't relevant to the passage. A is correct because the passage highlights John Bull being everyone's champion but later on whistling to himself and keeping his head down,

#### Question 38
Q: The repeated references to a "cudgel" throughout the second half of the passage mainly emphasize John Bull's
    A) physical stature and fortitude
    B) reputation of power and authority
    C) capacity for violence and retaliation
    D) renown as a champion of England
Original Answer: A
Correct Answer: B
Reasoning: 
Keeping in mind that John Bull is a satirical analogy to England, we can rule A and D out as it doesn't make sense for England to emphasize physical stature or being a champion of England when you are England personified. The references to the cudgel can't point to violence as John Bull, though always threatens to fight for someone with his cudgel, doesn't really fight, so we can mark C off. B is correct because the cudgel, something police used to use, was something John Bull brandished when trying to fight for someone, thus showing off his authority and power.

#### Question 40
Q: It can reasonably be inferred that John Bull suffers financial hardship primarily because
    A) his family members feel entitled to their extravagances and refuse to economize
    B) his pursuit of restoring his family's social standing leads him into bad investments
    C) his support of local authorities and community groups outpaces his diminished resources
    D) his pride in his family's holdings compromises his ability to manage them well
Original Answer: A 
Correct Answer: D
Reasoning: 
I was struggling to pick between A and D. Mostly because of the line where is states "to be bounteous in its appointments and eaten up by *dependents*" But since I picked (and got correct) the evidence question right next to it, it couldn't have been A since it's right before the chosen evidence, which supports choice D.

#### Question 46
Q: Which choice provides the best evidence for the answer to the previous question?
    A) Lines 38-40 ("And the ... asleep")
    B) Lines 58-61 ("The recruits ... hemispheres")
    C) Lines 74-78 ("This ... are")
    D) Lines 79-82 ("To confirm ... environments")
Original Answer: B
Correct Answer: A
Reasoning: 
The evidence we are looking for should be able to prove that people who had weaker left hemisphere slow-wave activity during the first night are more wakeful when presented with environmental stimuli while sleeping in a new place. I honestly don't really know how I missed this one as choice A clearly states "the stronger this asymmetry, the longer the volunteers took to fall asleep"

#### Question 52
Q: Based on the passage and figures 1 and 2, how would the plotted points in figure 1 most likely change if the left hemisphere data was focused on responses 400ms after sound onset?
    A) The point for the left hemisphere on Day 1 only would be more positive.
    B) The points for the right hemisphere would be more negative
    C) The points for the left hemisphere would be more positive
    D) The points on Day 2 would be greater than zero
Original Answer: D
Correct Answer: C
Reasoning: 
I have no clue ngl. So I'm going to use the textbook answer... I still have no clue.
